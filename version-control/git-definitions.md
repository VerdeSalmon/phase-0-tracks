# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

> *It is a tool to manage changes in code projects over time, by keeping track of every modification, allowing you to protect the source code from irreversible mistakes, it also helps to decrease conflict working concurrently with others and make possible traceability of project development.*

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

> *It is a copy of the original code source, that is created as a derivation of the original source but stays independent, which is usuful to work concurrenly with a team or solo in different type of changes, helping to set a workflow we want.*

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

> *It is the record of the changes in the repository, it should be done with an explanatory message. A good commit message is the one that is clear and explicit about what is being recorded in that commit, what substantial changes were made.* 

* What is a merge conflict?
> *It is when people, two or more, changed the same lines in the same file, using different branches, so when is time to integrate them, git shows the problematic area.*
