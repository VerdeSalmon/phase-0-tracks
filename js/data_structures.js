// Release 0: Work with Arrays

// declare two separate arrays:
// an array of four colors ("blue", for instance, though you're welcome to get crazy with something like "iridescent blue/green with silver sparkles")
// an array of four names that you might give a horse ("Ed" is always a solid choice to start with)
// write code that adds another color to the colors array, and another horse name to the horses array.


var horseName = ["Ed", "Ginger","Glitter","Vanila"];
var horseColor = ["blue", "yellow","pink blue stripes","rainbow"];

horseName.push("Joe");
horseColor.push("green spots");

// Release 1: Build an Object

// add code that will use your two arrays to create an object.
// The keys of your object should be horse names, and the values should be colors. 
// would work for any number of colors/horses, as long as the two arrays are the same length


// Release 2: Build Many Objects Using a Constructor

// write a constructor function for a car. 
// Give it a few different properties of various data types, including at least one function. 
// Demonstrate that your function works by creating a few cars with it.
